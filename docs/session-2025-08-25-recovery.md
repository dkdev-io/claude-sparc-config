## Session Context
**Project**: Live Stream Buddy MVP  
**Start Time**: 17:15 UTC  
**Recovery From**: Session freeze during build validation  

## Recovery Actions Completed

### 1. Session Freeze Analysis
- **Issue**: xargs command line length exceeded limits during hooks processing
- **Impact**: Session frozen during final build validation
- **Root Cause**: Complex Claude Flow hooks command preprocessing
