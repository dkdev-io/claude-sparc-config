# ScheduleMe Session Checkout - August 25, 2025

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Multi-hour development sprint
**Project**: ScheduleMe MVP - Social Media Scheduling Platform
**Branch**: main (commit: 6bd76ed)

## Work Accomplished

### 1. Bluesky Integration Completion
- ‚úÖ Complete Bluesky API integration with AT Protocol
- ‚úÖ Authentication flow with app passwords
- ‚úÖ Post scheduling and publishing functionality
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting and error handling
- ‚úÖ User interface for Bluesky account management

### 2. Platform Comparison Analysis
- ‚úÖ Evaluated Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Meta APIs
- ‚úÖ Integration complexity assessment
- ‚úÖ Rate limit comparison
- ‚úÖ User base analysis

### 3. Infrastructure Improvements
- ‚úÖ Added worker configuration (Dockerfile.worker)
- ‚úÖ Worker initialization script (worker-start.js)
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions security scan workflow
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics tracking updates

### 4. Platform Support Matrix

| Platform  | Status      | Users | Integration |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Twitter/X | ‚úÖ Complete | 400M  | 3-5 days    |
| Bluesky   | ‚úÖ Complete | 28M   | 1-2 days    |
| Meta APIs | üî¥ Skipped  | 2B+   | 2-4 weeks   |

## Technical Decisions

1. **Bluesky Priority**: Chose Bluesky over Meta due to simpler integration
2. **AT Protocol**: Implemented proper Bluesky authentication
3. **Worker Architecture**: Added background job processing
4. **Security**: Enhanced with automated scanning workflows

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - Security scanning automation
- `backend/Dockerfile.worker` - Worker container configuration
- `backend/worker-start.js` - Worker initialization script

### Modified Files
- Multiple performance and metrics tracking files
- Backend and frontend package configurations
- Integration test updates

## Current State

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Full Twitter/X integration
- Complete Bluesky integration
- Worker infrastructure setup
- Security workflow automation
- Performance monitoring

### üî¥ Issues
- GitHub push blocked (OAuth workflow permissions)
- Need to configure environment variables for production
- Meta APIs integration postponed

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure Bluesky API credentials
2. **Deployment**: Deploy unified platform to production
3. **Testing**: End-to-end testing of both platforms
4. **GitHub Permissions**: Resolve workflow push permissions
5. **User Onboarding**: Prepare launch documentation

## Resource Usage
- Commit: 6bd76ed (local, not pushed due to permissions)
- Files changed: 14 files, 1,820 insertions, 23 deletions
- Integration: Dual-platform social media scheduling ready

## Restoration Context
- Project is in `/Users/Danallovertheplace/ScheduleMe`
- Both Twitter and Bluesky integrations are code-complete
- Ready for production deployment and testing
- Architecture supports easy addition of more platforms

## Strategic Notes
- ScheduleMe now has competitive advantage with dual-platform support
- Bluesky integration provides early-mover advantage in growing platform
- Worker architecture scales for high-volume scheduling
- Security-first approach with automated scanning
